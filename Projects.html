		<div class="para">
		This is the most profound question that I have to answer wherever I go. The term data mining comes
		from the two words data and mining. Data is raw bytes, whereas mining is the process of obtaining
		something from the recesses of the deep. Therefore data mining simply refers to the process of
		obtaining information.

		<div class="para">
		Python is the king in the world of data science. Why Python? Though python is an interpreted 
		language and not so fast compared to C++, it has so many advantages over other languages that can
		not be overlooked. In my book Python Cookbook, I discuss in depth the potency of python.
